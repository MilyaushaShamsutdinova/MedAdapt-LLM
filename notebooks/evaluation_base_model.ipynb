The delivery was complicated by a vaginal laceration that required extensive suturing once the infant was delivered. Immediately after delivery of the placenta she experienced intense shaking and chills that resolved within 1 hour. She has felt well since the delivery but admits to 6 days of malodorous smelling vaginal discharge that is tan in color. She has a history of vaginal candidiasis and is worried that it may be recurring. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 122/73 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 16/min, and BMI is 33 kg/m^2. Speculum exam reveals a 1.5 cm dark red, velvety lesion on the posterior vaginal wall with a tan discharge. The pH of the discharge is 6.4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?',\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the access site affects early outcomes in endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins. Let me start by reading the context carefully.\n",

      "The study was about evaluating the effectiveness of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) on small saphenous varicose veins. The patients had unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small vein reflux. They used EVLA with a 14 W diode laser at 810 nm. After the procedure, they had ambulatory phlebectomies to remove the vein.\n",
      "\n",
      "They divided the patients into two groups based on where the access was made: above mid-calf (AMC, 33 patients) and below mid-calf (BMC, 26 patients). Both groups showed significant improvement in clinical scores like V Cass, AVVQ, and short form 36 QOL. The improvement was up to 1 year, and the differences were statistically significant (P<.05). \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at complications, the AMC group had fewer incidents of phlebitis (2 vs. 6%) and paresthesia (2 vs. 3.8%). The BMC group had more phlebitis (1 vs. 6%) and paresthesia (5 vs. 19%). However, the recurrence rates were similar for both groups (3 vs. 9% for recurrence). \n",
